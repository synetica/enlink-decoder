## Sample codec files
> We have included separate example codec files in the `archive` folder for each type of enLink model. This makes it easier when using the 'measurements' feature in Chirpstack v4. </br>
> This is not required by Chirpstack as the general codec works for all models. There will be no further development from v7.15/7.16 onwards.
If someone requires help in updating these files please contact us.
